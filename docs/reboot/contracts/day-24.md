# Day 24 — 2026-11-12: Explain and improve one real query

**State:** Real-PostgreSQL fixture and plan/result acceptance test are installed. The index migration is an explicit learner TODO; no query-plan improvement is claimed.

## Learner seam

history query index migration / query note. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Choose Day 16 query; seed representative synthetic data; capture plan before/after suitable index; preserve output/order; avoid brittle time thresholds and forced-index claims.

## Required edge cases

Before/after EXPLAIN, result equivalence, index write/storage trade-off.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 8 and 16; deterministic larger SQL seed. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Record a baseline query plan and measurement before changing one query/index. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

B-tree indexes, selectivity, EXPLAIN vs EXPLAIN ANALYZE [O].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Both plans and concise trade-off note. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day24ContractTest test`

This selector starts real embedded PostgreSQL and captures EXPLAIN plans plus ordered result equivalence. It fails at the explicit index migration TODO; no time-threshold or planner-choice assertion is used. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Why did this index change the plan? When could a sequential scan still be sensible?

**Observable evidence:** Compare real plans, data size, selectivity, ordering and write/storage cost; distinguish measurement from guaranteed speedup.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.

**Related source:** [A5](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a5) (anecdotal). These references guide practice; they do not establish question frequency or predict interview content.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date 2026-11-12 --roadmap-day 24` first. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
