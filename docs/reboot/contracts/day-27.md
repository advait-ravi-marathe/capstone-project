# Day 27 — 2026-11-15: Fix one evidence-backed regression

**State:** Saved JSON boundary reproducer and fixed learner test are installed; the regression behavior remains a learner acceptance failure until verified.

## Learner seam

targeted learner test and small production fix. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Select highest-value observed failure; reproduce first, then fix and rerun targeted plus affected contracts. If none exists, add one missing boundary test. Do not invent a defect or add a feature.

## Required edge cases

Before state must show reproducible failure or missing boundary; after targeted and affected checks.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Relevant failed day; saved fixture reproducer. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Use the saved reproducer to trace the regression to its owning module. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Debugging hypothesis, regression prevention, scope control.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Before/after assertion and affected-suite result. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day27ContractTest test`

This selector loads the saved JSON reproducer and exercises the existing learner policy. The TODO failure is expected and does not represent an observed production defect. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**New pattern anchor:** LeetCode 35 Search Insert Position — boundary search. Learn the pattern for 25 minutes, solve independently for 20 minutes, and spend 15 minutes on same-day D recall plus the error log. Record the actual first-attempt date; schedule D+3, D+7 and D+21 reviews from that date. Planned dates in the manifest are forecasts only. A failed prerequisite/review displaces the next new anchor; do not add overtime. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
## Understanding check (within the existing 10-minute evidence block)

Choose one or two prompts and keep the response brief. This check uses the existing 10 evidence minutes; it is not extra work.

1. Explain what Day 27 (Fix one evidence-backed regression) does, why its data structure, module boundary, or transaction choice fits, one alternative, and one failure case.
2. Without AI assistance, make or debug one small change to this feature and explain the observed result.

Record behavior (fixed-test result), explanation (invariants and trade-offs), and independent adaptation as separate outcomes. A scaffold or passing tests alone earns no explanation or adaptation credit.
