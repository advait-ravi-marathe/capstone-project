# Day 05 — 2026-10-24: Decide HomeSecure eligibility

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

`HomeSecureEligibilityPolicy`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Use fixture bounds `100000.00..10000000.00` INR inclusive and required occupancy `OWNER_OCCUPIED`. Return eligible only when occupancy is exact and amount is in range. Reason precedence is missing occupancy/amount → `REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING`; other occupancy → `OWNER_OCCUPIED_REQUIRED`; out-of-range amount → `REBUILD_AMOUNT_OUT_OF_RANGE`. The decision is training-only, not insurance advice.

## Required edge cases

Amounts `99999.99`, `100000.00`, `10000000.00`, `10000000.01`; absent fields; non-owner-occupied property; simultaneous invalidities use fixture reason precedence.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 4; catalog bounds fixture, no live controller. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Pure functions, invariants and decision tables.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Decision table mapped to parameterized tests. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day05ContractTest test`

This focused test and its learner TODO seam are installed. The command was run with the other installed Day 2–7 selectors; expected TODO failures are recorded in `evidence/reboot/initial-contracts-2026-10-20.json`. It is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 80 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
