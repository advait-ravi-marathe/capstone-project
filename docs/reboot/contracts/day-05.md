# Day 05 — 2026-10-24: Decide HomeSecure eligibility

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

`HomeSecureEligibilityPolicy`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Use fixture bounds `100000.00..10000000.00` INR inclusive and required occupancy `OWNER_OCCUPIED`. Return eligible only when occupancy is exact and amount is in range. Reason precedence is missing occupancy/amount → `REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING`; other occupancy → `OWNER_OCCUPIED_REQUIRED`; out-of-range amount → `REBUILD_AMOUNT_OUT_OF_RANGE`. The decision is training-only, not insurance advice.

## Required edge cases

Amounts `99999.99`, `100000.00`, `10000000.00`, `10000000.01`; absent fields; non-owner-occupied property; simultaneous invalidities use fixture reason precedence.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 4; catalog bounds fixture, no live controller. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Record the eligibility invariant and reason-precedence decision table. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Pure functions, invariants and decision tables.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Decision table mapped to parameterized tests. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day05ContractTest test`

This focused test and its learner TODO seam are installed. The command was run with the other installed Day 2–7 selectors; expected TODO failures are recorded in `evidence/reboot/initial-contracts-2026-10-20.json`. It is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Why make eligibility a pure policy? Which exact boundary is eligible?

**Observable evidence:** Turn the frozen decision table into boundary tests; explain why database and HTTP concerns do not belong in the rule.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.

**Related source:** [A7](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a7) (anecdotal); [A8](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a8) (anecdotal). These references guide practice; they do not establish question frequency or predict interview content.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date "$(TZ=Asia/Kolkata date +%F)" --roadmap-day 5` first. This command uses the actual Asia/Kolkata local study date; contract dates are forecasts only. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
