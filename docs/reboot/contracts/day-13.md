# Day 13 — 2026-11-01: Add honest repeatable CI

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

existing CI workflow/build config. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Java 21 compile, infrastructure tests and explicitly selected verified contracts run from clean checkout; failures propagate nonzero; unfinished contracts remain pending, not green. No deploy credentials.

## Required edge cases

Clean-checkout commands; deliberate test failure proves nonzero propagation; manifest not calendar-derived.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 1–12 status manifest and fixture smoke. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Test pyramid, reproducibility, CI failure signals [I].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Actual local/CI-equivalent output; do not claim remote run if absent. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day13ContractTest test`

This exact selector is part of the contract, but this test class is not installed yet. The command must not be reported as passing until the instructor scaffold exists and is actually run. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 58 Length of Last Word. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
