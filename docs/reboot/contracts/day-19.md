# Day 19 — 2026-11-07: Display quote snapshot

**State:** React/TypeScript component scaffold and fixed acceptance tests are installed; learner implementation remains pending. The focused suite is expected to fail at unimplemented rendering/interaction behavior.

## Learner seam

`QuoteSummary.tsx`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Show server `annualPremiumRupees`, currency, `productVersion`, `rateVersion`, and `expiresAt` exactly; browser never recomputes price. Loading/error/refresh are explicit; latest request wins when responses arrive out of order.

## Required edge cases

Exact decimal text, error/loading, deferred promises resolved out of order.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 7 response contract; controlled deferred promises. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Map a quote snapshot response to its display state, including loading/error outcomes. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Async UI, race conditions and state ownership [K,L].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Out-of-order response component test. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`npm --prefix frontend test -- --run src/__tests__/Day19Contract.test.tsx`

This selector runs the installed component contract tests. Expected red assertions identify the unimplemented learner behavior; that is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**New pattern anchor:** LeetCode 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum — shrinking valid window. Learn the pattern for 25 minutes, solve independently for 20 minutes, and spend 15 minutes on same-day D recall plus the error log. Record the actual first-attempt date; schedule D+3, D+7 and D+21 reviews from that date. Planned dates in the manifest are forecasts only. A failed prerequisite/review displaces the next new anchor; do not add overtime. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
## Understanding check (within the existing 10-minute evidence block)

Choose one or two prompts and keep the response brief. This check uses the existing 10 evidence minutes; it is not extra work.

1. Explain what Day 19 (Display quote snapshot) does, why its data structure, module boundary, or transaction choice fits, one alternative, and one failure case.
2. Without AI assistance, make or debug one small change to this feature and explain the observed result.

Record behavior (fixed-test result), explanation (invariants and trade-offs), and independent adaptation as separate outcomes. A scaffold or passing tests alone earns no explanation or adaptation credit.
