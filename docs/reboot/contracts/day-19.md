# Day 19 — 2026-11-11: Display quote snapshot

**State:** React/TypeScript component scaffold and fixed acceptance tests are installed; learner implementation remains pending. The focused suite is expected to fail at unimplemented rendering/interaction behavior.

**Coursework before implementation:** If available, use course 1362070 “Using async / await” (2:25) and “Handling Loading States” (5:27), 7:52 total; access is unconfirmed. TanStack query-key/cancellation videos are not assigned. First use the [Day 19 deferred-refresh guide](../teaching/day-19-latest-refresh.md#worked-trace) to trace stale success, stale error, and stale finally behavior. No new dependency; total study 25 minutes.

## Learner seam

`QuoteSummary.tsx`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Show server `annualPremiumRupees`, currency, `productVersion`, `rateVersion`, and `expiresAt` exactly; browser never recomputes price. Loading/error/refresh are explicit; latest request wins when responses arrive out of order.

## Required edge cases

Exact decimal text, error/loading, deferred promises resolved out of order.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 7 response contract; controlled deferred promises. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

**Assistant-provided capstone architecture:** [../assistant-architecture-notes-15-70.md#day-19](<../assistant-architecture-notes-15-70.md#day-19>). This note supplies the implementation decision and concise rationale; read it within this day's existing 25-minute concept/course allocation, not as extra work. Use it as context for the day's existing task; on implementation days, implement and test the stated design. It is supplied awareness, not a design exercise. No capstone architecture proposal or post-hoc justification is assigned; learner design proposals occur only for the assigned system-design interview question on scheduled mock days.

Async UI, race conditions and state ownership [K,L].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Out-of-order response component test. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, assistance, and any blocker. Record observed results only. Record the assistant-provided architecture note used; no capstone design proposal or retrospective justification is assigned.

## Planned isolated command

`npm --prefix frontend test -- --run src/__tests__/Day19Contract.test.tsx`

This selector runs the installed component contract tests. Expected red assertions identify the unimplemented learner behavior; that is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate DSA track

The daily DSA assignment, tests, review schedule, and attempt history live only in the [DSA preparation repository](https://github.com/advait-ravi-marathe/dsa-prep/tree/b9d4706a9ead281a8881ab3767aa415ad6039f14). This engineering contract contains no DSA assignment.
