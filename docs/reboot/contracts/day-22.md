# Day 22 — 2026-11-10: Add safe request correlation

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

request filter / error mapping. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Every response has `X-Request-Id` matching `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`. Missing IDs are generated; malformed supplied IDs replaced. One error log references the selected ID, never applicant body/token/cookie. Request IDs are not metric labels.

## Required edge cases

Absent, valid, malformed ID; captured-log redaction assertions.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 3; fixed request fixtures and fake logger. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Observability vs privacy, logs vs metrics.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Captured log assertions. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day22ContractTest test`

This exact selector is part of the contract, but this test class is not installed yet. The command must not be reported as passing until the instructor scaffold exists and is actually run. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
