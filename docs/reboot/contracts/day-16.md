# Day 16 — 2026-11-04: Bound quote-history reads

**State:** Real-PostgreSQL pagination fixture and learner query seam installed. The focused tests currently stop at the explicit pagination TODO.

## Learner seam

`QuoteHistoryQuery`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

`GET /api/journeys/{journeyId}/quotes` uses zero-based `page` (default 0), `size` (default 10, maximum 20), newest first by `createdAt` descending, then `quoteVersionId` ascending for ties. Empty/final pages are valid. Negative page, size below 1 or above 20 returns 400 `INVALID_REQUEST`.

## Required edge cases

Timestamp ties, page size 0/over 20, empty/final page, adjacent pages have no duplicate.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 9 and 12; seeded history. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Choose a data-flow or sequence view for bounded quote history and its ownership boundary. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Sorting, pagination cost and query complexity.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Adjacent page fixture assertions. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day16ContractTest test`

This selector starts a real embedded PostgreSQL instance with timestamp ties and multiple pages. Expected TODO failures are not a pagination or infrastructure pass.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**Consolidation day — no new mandatory problem.** Use 25 minutes to refresh due patterns, 20 minutes to cold-solve the weakest due anchor, and 15 minutes for same-day/other due active recall and the error log. Planned review items: LC 238 (D+7 from Day 9), LC 167 (D+3 from Day 13). Recompute from actual first-attempt dates and record completion only after the review. If no review is actually due, cold-recall the weakest earlier anchor; failed recall displaces the next new anchor. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
## Understanding check (within the existing 10-minute evidence block)

Choose one or two prompts and keep the response brief. This check uses the existing 10 evidence minutes; it is not extra work.

1. Explain what Day 16 (Bound quote-history reads) does, why its data structure, module boundary, or transaction choice fits, one alternative, and one failure case.
2. Without AI assistance, make or debug one small change to this feature and explain the observed result.

Record behavior (fixed-test result), explanation (invariants and trade-offs), and independent adaptation as separate outcomes. A scaffold or passing tests alone earns no explanation or adaptation credit.
