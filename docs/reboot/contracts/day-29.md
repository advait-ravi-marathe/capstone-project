# Day 29 — 2026-11-17: Make the slice reproducible

**State:** Safety/refusal tests and a positive reset integration test on fresh embedded PostgreSQL are installed. `--embedded-test --confirm-disposable` needs no psql or remote target; external URI reset remains explicitly guarded.

## Learner seam

README/runbook plus deterministic fixture reset command. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Add `scripts/reset-synthetic-homesecure.sh` (invocation: `./scripts/reset-synthetic-homesecure.sh --database-url "$TEST_DATABASE_URL" --confirm-disposable`) and document clean setup: full JDK 21, pinned Maven wrapper, disposable PostgreSQL, no secrets, required tests and recovery. This reset is test-only and must target a disposable database; it accepts only a DB name ending `_test` and requires `--confirm-disposable`. Otherwise it exits nonzero before connecting or deleting data. It restores exact synthetic fixture state. Never point it at a development, shared, staging, or production database.

## Required edge cases

Reset disposable DB and verify exact seed; missing confirmation and DB name without `_test` both refuse before destructive SQL.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 13 and 28; fresh disposable test-only environment. Reset must never target development, shared, staging, or production data. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Map one-command setup/reset lifecycle and identify the disposable-data safety boundary. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Configuration, environment parity, safe operations.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Another clean setup or exact unverified steps/blocker. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Dtest=Day29ResetIntegrationTest test`

The positive check resets twice in a newly started embedded PostgreSQL instance and verifies the exact synthetic rows. The shell command is `./scripts/reset-synthetic-homesecure.sh --embedded-test --confirm-disposable`; external URI mode still needs psql and a confirmed `*_test` target.

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Could another engineer reproduce the result? What state can reset safely destroy?

**Observable evidence:** Rerun clean setup, name pinned versions/config and disposable-data guard; label unexecuted setup steps unverified.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.

**Related source:** [Official expectations](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#official-expectations) (official). These references guide practice; they do not establish question frequency or predict interview content.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date "$(TZ=Asia/Kolkata date +%F)" --roadmap-day 29` first. This command uses the actual Asia/Kolkata local study date; contract dates are forecasts only. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
