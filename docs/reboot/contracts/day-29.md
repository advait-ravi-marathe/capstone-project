# Day 29 — 2026-11-17: Make the slice reproducible

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

README/runbook plus deterministic fixture reset command. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Add `scripts/reset-synthetic-homesecure.sh` (invocation: `./scripts/reset-synthetic-homesecure.sh --database-url "$TEST_DATABASE_URL" --confirm-disposable`) and document clean setup: full JDK 21, pinned Maven wrapper, disposable PostgreSQL, no secrets, required tests and recovery. Reset accepts only a DB name ending `_test` and requires `--confirm-disposable`; otherwise it exits nonzero before connecting or deleting data. It restores exact synthetic fixture state.

## Required edge cases

Reset disposable DB and verify exact seed; missing confirmation and DB name without `_test` both refuse before destructive SQL.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 13 and 28; fresh disposable environment. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Configuration, environment parity, safe operations.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Another clean setup or exact unverified steps/blocker. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day29ContractTest test`

This exact selector is part of the contract, but this test class is not installed yet. The command must not be reported as passing until the instructor scaffold exists and is actually run. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 49 Group Anagrams. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
