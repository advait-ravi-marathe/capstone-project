# Day 17 — 2026-11-05: Render product choices in React/TypeScript

**State:** Minimal React/TypeScript workspace, fixed component tests, and learner TODO are installed. The UI workspace builds, while all component behavior tests currently fail at the placeholder.

## Learner seam

`frontend/src/components/ProductPanel.tsx`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Typed fixture renders labels/options; loading/error/empty explicit; accessible names; no hard-coded production URL. Test adapter avoids dependency on earlier live backend.

## Required edge cases

Loading, error, empty, product options, accessibility query, no real fetch.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 4 contract; canned fetch adapter. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Sketch the UI state and API boundary needed for product choices; keep server policy authoritative. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Typed props and discriminated UI state [K,L].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Component tests and screenshot. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`npm --prefix frontend test -- src/components/ProductPanel.test.tsx`

Run this focused component suite; its four failures are expected at the Day 17 TODO. `npm --prefix frontend run build` verifies TypeScript/bundling separately. The Vite app is only a test scaffold; it does not claim a finished UI.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**New pattern anchor:** LeetCode 3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters — variable sliding window. Learn the pattern for 25 minutes, solve independently for 20 minutes, and spend 15 minutes on same-day D recall plus the error log. Record the actual first-attempt date; schedule D+3, D+7 and D+21 reviews from that date. Planned dates in the manifest are forecasts only. A failed prerequisite/review displaces the next new anchor; do not add overtime. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Which UI states exist before and after a request? Why do types not replace runtime checks?

**Observable evidence:** Show loading/error/empty/content behavior, accessible labels and typed boundaries; explain state ownership.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.
