# Day 15 — 2026-11-03: Read journey summary

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

`JourneySummaryQuery`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Return exactly `{journeyId, quote, selections}`. `quote` is null or the Day 7 snapshot projection; `selections` contains `{quoteVersionId, selectionOrder}` ordered by `selectionOrder` ascending. Empty selections are valid. Unknown/other-owned journey uses the same non-disclosing 404. No entity or owner field may escape.

## Required edge cases

Empty, populated, unknown, other-owned, and exact JSON field allowlist.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 9 and 12; seeded read model. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

SQL joins, projections, null/empty semantics [E,F].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Empty/populated JSON fixtures. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day15ContractTest test`

This exact selector is part of the contract, but this test class is not installed yet. The command must not be reported as passing until the instructor scaffold exists and is actually run. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 151 Reverse Words in a String. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
