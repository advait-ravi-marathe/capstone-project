# Day 28 — 2026-11-16: Milestone 2 browser-to-database acceptance

**State:** Blocked-readiness policy seam and fixed test are installed. It does not implement or claim the browser-to-database integration; Days 14–27 remain prerequisites.

## Learner seam

`HomeSecureFlow` test. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

UI input → quote snapshot → owner selection → refreshed summary survives reload. Cover duplicate clicks, stale/expired conflict, other-user access and backend outage. No purchase or policy-issuance claim.

## Required edge cases

Success/reload; double submit; stale/expired; other user; outage.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 14–27; readiness checker reports gaps; real completed components and PostgreSQL. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Draw the browser-to-database path and mark each prerequisite that is still blocked. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

One request end to end, security and consistency boundaries.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Automated report/screenshots and milestone rubric. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day28ContractTest test`

This selector checks the readiness policy only. It is expected to fail at its explicit TODO while prerequisites are incomplete. It does not run or substitute for the browser-to-database gate. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**Consolidation day — no new mandatory problem.** Use 25 minutes to refresh due patterns, 20 minutes to cold-solve the weakest due anchor, and 15 minutes for same-day/other due active recall and the error log. Planned review items: LC 49 (D+21 from Day 7), LC 20 (D+7 from Day 21), LC 704 (D+3 from Day 25). Recompute from actual first-attempt dates and record completion only after the review. If no review is actually due, cold-recall the weakest earlier anchor; failed recall displaces the next new anchor. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
## Understanding check (within the existing 10-minute evidence block)

Choose one or two prompts and keep the response brief. This check uses the existing 10 evidence minutes; it is not extra work.

1. Explain what Day 28 (Milestone 2 browser-to-database acceptance) does, why its data structure, module boundary, or transaction choice fits, one alternative, and one failure case.
2. Without AI assistance, make or debug one small change to this feature and explain the observed result.

Record behavior (fixed-test result), explanation (invariants and trade-offs), and independent adaptation as separate outcomes. A scaffold or passing tests alone earns no explanation or adaptation credit.
