# Day 25 — 2026-11-17: Handle concurrent repeated selection

**State:** Real-PostgreSQL concurrent service contract is installed with a barrier and an isolated composite-key table. The writer is an explicit learner TODO; an HTTP endpoint/200-response integration remains open.

**Course/concept bridge:** No exact verified lecture covers this race. Read the named PostgreSQL transactions, Read Committed, and `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` sections, then run the [Day 25 guide](../teaching/day-25-unique-race.md#two-transaction-trace) within the existing 25-minute block. See the [Days 1–30 map](../course-learning-map.md); exact catalog title metadata is not a claim of playback.

## Learner seam

persistence conflict mapping. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Two simultaneous authorized requests for the same pair create one row and both return HTTP 200 with the same selection representation; no unique-violation 500. Use two real transactions and a synchronization barrier; distinct from Day 1 in-batch dedup.

## Required edge cases

Concurrent same pair, different pair, final row count and both response bodies.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 8 and 10–12; canned authorized/current quote. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**Worked prompt:** Draw both transaction lanes and explain why the losing transaction must rollback before a fresh read.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Unique-key collision, PostgreSQL aborted transaction, rollback, and fresh-connection read.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Barrier-coordinated concurrency test; no sleeps. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day25ContractTest test`

This selector runs two concurrent calls against real PostgreSQL using a cyclic barrier and a fixed isolated schema. Both tests reach the explicit writer TODO. The current scaffold is service-level only; HTTP status/body and authorization wiring remain blocked and are not claimed. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Two app instances both see no existing row, then insert. Why can an in-memory lock or Day 1 dedup be insufficient?

**Observable evidence:** Draw the interleaving; run two transactions with a barrier; prove one row and the documented repeat result; distinguish JVM thread safety from cross-instance database correctness.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.

**Related source:** [A4](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a4) (anecdotal); [A7](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a7) (anecdotal). These references guide practice; they do not establish question frequency or predict interview content.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date "$(TZ=Asia/Kolkata date +%F)" --roadmap-day 25` first. This command uses the actual Asia/Kolkata local study date; contract dates are forecasts only. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
