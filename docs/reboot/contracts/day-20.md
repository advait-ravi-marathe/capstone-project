# Day 20 — 2026-11-08: Connect selection action UI

**State:** React/TypeScript component scaffold and fixed acceptance tests are installed; learner implementation remains pending. The focused suite is expected to fail at unimplemented rendering/interaction behavior.

## Learner seam

`SelectQuoteButton.tsx`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

POST exact journey/version once while pending. HTTP 200 is server-confirmed selection; 409 prompts refresh, 401 prompts sign-in, 404 shows unavailable. Never imply purchase or active coverage.

## Required edge cases

Success, conflict, auth, unavailable, network error, double click.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 1, 3 and 11 response contracts; fake API. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**System-design prompt (within the 25-minute concept block):** Draw the selection click-to-response flow and mark stale-version handling. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

HTTP side effects, retry decisions and truthful UI state.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Four component scenarios. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`npm --prefix frontend test -- --run src/__tests__/Day20Contract.test.tsx`

This selector runs the installed component contract tests. Expected red assertions identify the unimplemented learner behavior; that is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

**Consolidation day — no new mandatory problem.** Use 25 minutes to refresh due patterns, 20 minutes to cold-solve the weakest due anchor, and 15 minutes for same-day/other due active recall and the error log. Planned review items: LC 167 (D+7 from Day 13), LC 3 (D+3 from Day 17). Recompute from actual first-attempt dates and record completion only after the review. If no review is actually due, cold-recall the weakest earlier anchor; failed recall displaces the next new anchor. Use [`../dsa-error-log-template.md`](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
## Understanding check (within the existing 10-minute evidence block)

Choose one or two prompts and keep the response brief. This check uses the existing 10 evidence minutes; it is not extra work.

1. Explain what Day 20 (Connect selection action UI) does, why its data structure, module boundary, or transaction choice fits, one alternative, and one failure case.
2. Without AI assistance, make or debug one small change to this feature and explain the observed result.

Record behavior (fixed-test result), explanation (invariants and trade-offs), and independent adaptation as separate outcomes. A scaffold or passing tests alone earns no explanation or adaptation credit.
