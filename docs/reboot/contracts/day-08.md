# Day 08 — 2026-10-27: Define PostgreSQL quote schema

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

## Learner seam

Versioned `V...__homesecure_quotes.sql` migration. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Use `journeys`, `quote_versions`, and `selections`. `quote_versions` primary key is `(journey_id, quote_version_id)`; `selections` references that exact key and has unique `(journey_id, quote_version_id)` plus required `selection_order`. This prevents cross-journey selection at the database boundary and permits distinct versions in one journey.

## Required edge cases

Valid insert; null required field, duplicate pair, orphan quote reference, cross-journey reference rejected; two versions for one journey allowed. Test SQL constraints directly, not services.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 1 and 7; SQL seeds bypass services. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Relational keys, normalization, integrity [E].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Real PostgreSQL insert/rejection matrix. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day08ContractTest test`

This exact selector is part of the contract, but this test class is not installed yet. The command must not be reported as passing until the instructor scaffold exists and is actually run. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

LeetCode 122 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II. Use 10 minutes recall/example, 35 minutes independent attempt, 10 minutes tests/complexity and 5 minutes error log. An unfinished attempt is valid work, not a solved claim. Prior solved history is preserved and must not be inferred from a scaffold.
