# Day 03 — 2026-10-26: Map failures consistently

**State:** Contract defined; instructor fixture/test scaffold and learner attempt are pending. This page is a planned contract, not a test result.

**Required course lesson:** [Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6 with Java — in28Minutes Official](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-and-spring-framework-tutorial-for-beginners/), section “Creating a Java REST API with Spring Boot, Spring Framework and Hibernate”: “Step 12 - Implementing Generic Exception Handling for all Resources” (11:29; item 35018806). Study the [Day 3 safe-errors guide](../teaching/day-03-safe-errors.md) before implementation. “Step 11 - Implementing Exception Handling - 404 Resource Not Found” (7:49; item 35018810) is optional later reference, not stacked into today. Catalog metadata verified 2026-10-21; playback not verified. See the [Days 1–30 map](../course-learning-map.md).

## Learner seam

`ApiExceptionHandler`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Preserve the Day 2 error shape `{"code":"...","message":"..."}`. Unknown resource is HTTP 404 with `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` and `Resource was not found`; version conflict is HTTP 409 with `VERSION_CONFLICT` and `The resource version conflicts`; unexpected failure is HTTP 500 with `INTERNAL_ERROR` and `The request could not be completed`. Never return stack, SQL, request body or internal exception text.

## Required edge cases

Fixture not-found, conflict and unexpected exception; verify safe fields and no secret text.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Day 2; mocked service throws fixed fixture exceptions. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**Worked design question (after the guide):** Why does a client receive a stable error code while internal exception text stays out of the response? Do not create an ADR or architecture case study.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Study the required generic exception-handling lesson and the Day 3 guide: controller failure, matching exception handler, `ResponseEntity` status/body, and a fixed safe response for unknown errors. Do not copy the toy strings into the capstone or require the later Day 12 authorization distinction.

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Three negative response snapshots. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation.

## Instructor reference and preserved learner command

Run the independent worked example first: `./mvnw -Dtest=Day03SafeErrorsReferenceTest test`. Then use the existing learner selector: `./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day03ContractTest test`. This focused test and its learner TODO seam are installed. The command was run with the other installed Day 2–7 selectors; expected TODO failures are recorded in `evidence/reboot/initial-contracts-2026-10-20.json`. It is not a passing learner result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Interview-first system-design session (45 minutes inside the existing 85-minute practice block)

**Prompt:** [Q08](../interview/question-bank.md#q08) from the original question bank. Before any hint, reference answer, or AI, write your own initial proposal. Follow the exact 5/5/15/10/10 phases in [the mock rubric](../interview/mock-rubric.md): requirements; capacity and constraints; initial architecture and data model (save before help); bottlenecks, reliability and scaling; trade-offs, failures and follow-ups.

**Schedule:** 2026-10-26. This session replaces 45 minutes of implementation/test practice; the remaining 40 minutes stay for the day’s implementation and tests. Do not add time or mark a partial acceptance gate complete. Use the existing 10-minute evidence block for command, result, assistance, and blocker only. For the exact 40-minute EAI slice and deferred acceptance queue, follow [Sprint 1 session scope](../interview/session-scope.md); the original day stays pending until its full acceptance passes.

## Separate DSA track

The daily DSA assignment, tests, review schedule, and attempt history live only in the [DSA preparation repository](https://github.com/advait-ravi-marathe/dsa-prep/tree/b9d4706a9ead281a8881ab3767aa415ad6039f14). This engineering contract contains no DSA assignment.
