# Day 10 — 2026-10-29: Persist selection batch atomically

**State:** Instructor scaffold installed; learner implementation pending. Transaction behavior is checked with real PostgreSQL and a fixed schema/quote fixture that bypasses earlier service rules.

## Learner seam

`SelectionService`. Keep the business rule in this focused subject. Do not implement later-day behavior early.

## Acceptance invariants

Persist pre-normalized batch in one PostgreSQL transaction; failure on any row leaves none of the batch. Successful batch assigns contiguous zero-based `selection_order` in input order. Isolated test never calls unfinished Day 1 policy.

## Required edge cases

Empty batch, two valid rows, induced second-row failure, pre-existing rows remain.

## Prerequisite and isolation

Days 8–9; canned normalized pairs and forced repository failure. Earlier unfinished collaborators are replaced by explicit test-only canned values in this day's isolated test; do not copy their business solution into production. A later integrated gate remains blocked until its listed prerequisites are genuinely completed.

**PostgreSQL design prompt:** Identify primary/composite keys, normalization, constraints, and transaction/isolation boundary relevant to this day's schema/write; do not add infrastructure beyond the contract. See the [system design practice guide](../system-design-practice.md) and use only the applicable blank template.

## Concept (25 minutes)

Transactions, atomicity, rollback [G].

## Evidence (10 minutes)

Database state after injected mid-batch failure. Record dated attempt state (`not attempted`, `attempted`, `contract passed`, or `integrated passed`), exact command/exit status, changed paths, assertion before/after where applicable, and an invariant/trade-off explanation. DSA notes include Java attempt, edge cases, complexity and independent-solve status.

## Planned isolated command

`./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=Day10ContractTest test`

This selector runs the installed batch tests against a real embedded PostgreSQL server. The expected learner TODO failures are not a passing result. Infrastructure checks are separate.

## Interview transfer (inside the current evidence block)

**Question:** Where does the transaction begin and end? What if the second insert fails?

**Observable evidence:** Show post-failure database state; distinguish atomicity from isolation; explain the Spring transaction boundary and a proxy/self-invocation caveat.

**Assistance and gap:** Record unaided, hinted, or AI-assisted work honestly. For the change/debug prompt, work without AI. Score the relevant rubric dimensions 0–2 and name one bounded repair if a gap remains; do not treat tests as explanation credit.

**Related source:** [A4](../interview-evidence-overlay.md#a4) (anecdotal). These references guide practice; they do not establish question frequency or predict interview content.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date "$(TZ=Asia/Kolkata date +%F)" --roadmap-day 10` first. This command uses the actual Asia/Kolkata local study date; contract dates are forecasts only. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../dsa-error-log-template.md).
