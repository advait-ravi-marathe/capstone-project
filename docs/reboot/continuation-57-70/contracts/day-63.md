# Day 63 — 2026-12-21: Run the security trace and recovery checkpoint

## Contract

**Learner-owned seam:** `Readiness evidence and request trace`
**Status:** Contract defined; learner implementation not attempted.
**Time:** 180 minutes: 60 Java DSA + 120 engineering (85 implementation/testing, 25 concept/course, 10 evidence). No mandatory setup work.

### Expected behavior

Review the authorization path end to end, record the prior evidence gate, and take the timed mock checkpoint. If security acceptance is still red, repair it inside the same engineering budget before any planned next task.

## Acceptance and expected TODO state

The fixed learner selector is installed and currently fails at this day’s explicit TODO. Do not implement learner behavior in the starter or mark the contract complete.

**Acceptance test:** `src/test/java/assignments/local/LocalReadinessGateAcceptanceTest.java`
**Acceptance selector:** `day63SecurityCheckpointKeepsRecoveryInsideDailyBudget`
**Learner acceptance command:** `./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=LocalReadinessGateAcceptanceTest#day63SecurityCheckpointKeepsRecoveryInsideDailyBudget test`
**Instructor infrastructure test:** `src/test/java/assignments/local/LocalApplicationManifestInfrastructureTest.java`
**Instructor command:** `./mvnw -Dtest=LocalApplicationManifestInfrastructureTest test`
## Implementation/testing allocation (85 minutes)

Work only this day's seam. Reuse existing issuance, policy readback, eligibility, snapshot, idempotency and preview rules. Do not duplicate a domain rule or modify prior contracts. Use the fixed synthetic fixture, configured `Clock`, loopback local app and disposable PostgreSQL only where specified. No real identities, PII, passwords, OAuth, secrets, external services or persistent access grants. On a recovery day, replace planned work inside the existing 85 minutes; do not add overtime.

## Concept/course allocation (25 minutes)

**Learning guidance (inside the single 25-minute engineering study allocation):**
- No exact matching course lesson was verified for this task; no unrelated video is assigned.
- Fit: recovery review no new lecture. No new lecture or implementation feature. In the shared 25-minute study block, explain the existing security trace and recover only the first failing prerequisite; use the supplied instructor runtime and distinguish observed evidence from learner completion.
- Focused worked references: [Spring Security architecture — servlet architecture](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html).
- Video viewing: 0:00 at 1×; the remaining 25:00 in the 25-minute cap is for pauses, the worked example, focused reference and teach-back. Stop at 25 minutes; carry unfinished material forward and shrink implementation scope. Viewing is not learner completion.


**Design sketch:** Run the security trace and recovery checkpoint: show the key trust boundary or data invariant and which layer owns it.

**Teach-back:** Explain the invariant, its enforcement point and the observable evidence that proves it.

## Evidence allocation (10 minutes)

Record command, exact result, teach-back/design note and learner-owned changed paths in `evidence/continuation-57-70/day-63.json`. Leave completion and actual dates blank until the work is actually done.

## Separate Java DSA block (60 minutes)

No mandatory new problem. Run the shared actual-attempt queue first. Work on due reviews from actual first-attempt dates; if none are due, use cold retrieval and error-log repair from previous patterns. Do not infer attempts or completions from planned dates.

- 25 minutes focused pattern learning or recall
- 20 minutes independent attempt or due cold review
- 15 minutes active retrieval and error log

Run the shared queue before selecting work. D+3/D+7/D+21 use actual first-attempt dates from [the shared log](../../continuation-31-44/dsa/actual-attempt-log.json). A failed review replaces new work inside the same 60-minute block. See [the tree study map](../dsa/tree-study-map.md).

**Queue:** `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date 2026-12-21`
**Queue tests:** `python3 -m unittest scripts/test_dsa_review_queue.py scripts/test_dsa_review_queue_45_56.py scripts/test_dsa_review_queue_57_70.py`
