# Day 47 — 2026-12-05: Freeze the renewal reference snapshot

## Contract

**Learner-owned seam:** `PolicyRenewalPreviewPolicy.buildPreview`
**Status:** Contract defined; learner implementation not attempted.
**Time:** 180/195/210 minutes by DSA tier (60/75/90 DSA + unchanged 120 engineering) (85 implementation/testing, 25 concept/course, 10 evidence). No mandatory setup work.

### Expected behavior

Copy the frozen source policy ID/version, product/rate versions, current annual premium and currency into a preview; derive only the next term effective date. Records provide shallow immutability: their component references are final, but referenced mutable objects are not frozen. Prefer immutable value types for snapshot components. Include an explicit reference-only notice stating this is not a renewal offer or coverage commitment. Do not calculate a new price or mutate state.

## Acceptance and expected TODO state

Fixed acceptance tests verify observable rules and remain learner-owned. Do not implement behavior in the starter or weaken assertions. Before the named TODOs are completed, the selected learner test is expected to fail at that exact seam. Instructor infrastructure checks are separate and should pass. Record the exact command, exit code, assertions/errors and TODO reached in `evidence/continuation-45-56/day-47.json`. A contract, mock-only check, or infrastructure smoke does not claim product behavior is implemented.

**Acceptance test:** `src/test/java/assignments/insurance/PolicyRenewalAcceptanceTest.java`
**Acceptance command:** `./mvnw -Plearner-tests -Dtest=PolicyRenewalAcceptanceTest#day47PreviewCopiesCurrentSnapshotAndMakesNoRenewalPriceOrCommitment test`
**Instructor infrastructure test:** `src/test/java/assignments/renewal/RenewalPreviewManifestInfrastructureTest.java`
**Infrastructure command:** `./mvnw -Dtest=RenewalPreviewManifestInfrastructureTest test`

## Implementation/testing allocation (85 minutes)

Implement only this day's seam, run its fixed selector, and keep prior learner ownership intact. Use the synthetic fixture and fixed Clock; use isolated embedded PostgreSQL only where specified. No real customer data, payments, external services, migrations to a live database, or cloud setup.

## Concept/course allocation (25 minutes)

**Learning guidance (inside the single 25-minute engineering study allocation):**
- Course: [Java Programming for Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-programming-tutorial-for-beginners/) — in28Minutes Official; access: unconfirmed reference only. Do not purchase/enroll based on this map.
- Exact lesson title: **Step 15 - Exploring Java New Features - Records**; exact section title: **Java New Features - Java 10 to Java 24** (9:04).
- Exact lesson title: **3 Questions - Best practices with Records**; exact section title: **Core Java in Depth - Java Review (Interview) Guide** (9:58).
- Fit: partial foundation. Record guidance is only a foundation because record components can reference mutable objects. Work a preview snapshot containing immutable value types and prove later source changes do not alter it; preview never reprices or commits a renewal.
- Focused worked references: [Java 21 Record API — record components and shallow immutability](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Record.html).
- Video viewing: 19:02 at 1×; the remaining 5:58 in the 25-minute cap is for pauses, the worked example, focused reference and teach-back. Stop at 25 minutes; carry unfinished material forward and shrink implementation scope. Viewing is not learner completion.


**Design sketch:** Freeze the renewal reference snapshot: sketch the protected invariant and the layer that owns it.

**Teach-back:** State one invariant, its enforcing layer, and the observable response that proves it.

## Evidence allocation (10 minutes)

Record actual command/output, one design or teach-back note, and the learner's own changed paths in `evidence/continuation-45-56/day-47.json`. Record first-attempt and review dates only after the work is done.

## DSA study (workload-tiered; actual attempts only)

**Time:** 1–2 substantive exercises = 60 minutes; 3 = 75 minutes; 4 = 90 minutes. Keep engineering at 120 minutes (25 study, 85 practice/test, 10 evidence), for 180/195/210 total minutes. Brief recall and logging are inside the tier; do not add exercises to fill time or exceed four. Failed/overdue retrieval displaces new guidance; excess due work carries forward with its original due date, including D+21.

**Guided/transfer selection:** First process actual failed or overdue D+3/D+7/D+21 retrieval, then due retrieval, then an eligible guided first encounter in the preserved prerequisite order. New introductions stop after roadmap Day 150. Candidate transfers come from the verified catalog only after checking prior exposure, access, and prerequisite readiness; unknown freshness is not fresh. Do not assign by old even/odd cadence.

Guided learning may use LeetCode Premium/editorial explanations. Before opening an editorial, attempt independently; if assistance is used, label the event guided/hinted/editorial-assisted even if accepted. A transfer is independent only after an unaided attempt, with the intended invariant explained; platform acceptance alone is insufficient. D, D+3, D+7, and D+21 are based on the earliest actual first-attempt local date, including guided attempts; never use planned dates or reset the clock. A transfer target does not start another anchor cycle.

Run `python3 scripts/dsa-review-queue.py --on-date "$(TZ=Asia/Kolkata date +%F)" --roadmap-day 47` first. The date command uses the actual Asia/Kolkata local study date; dates shown elsewhere are forecasts only. Record actual activity, assistance, outcome, and evidence in the append-only log; never infer completion from this contract. See [../../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md](../../dsa/guided-transfer-policy.md) and [the DSA error log](../../dsa-error-log-template.md).
